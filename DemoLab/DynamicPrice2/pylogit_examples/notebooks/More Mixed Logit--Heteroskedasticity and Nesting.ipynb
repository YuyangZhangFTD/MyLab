    "From this perspective, using a mixed-logit model to account for heteroskedasticity is equivalent to using a mixed-logit model where the alternative-specific constants are viewed as being randomly distributed throughout the population.\n",

    "In particular, we will instruct PyLogit to treat the alternative specific constants as normally distributed random variables, where we will estimate the mean and standard deviations of the distributions. Note that in order to estimate the $\\sigma_{\\textrm{car}}$ of the car alternative, we need to have a variable for the alternative specific constant of the car. We will therefore add the car to the intercept specification, but we will then constrain it to zero during estimation (and as noted in the equation above).\n",

    "In certain cases, one might wish to allow for correlated utilities. In particular, we use the $\\epsilon_{ij}$ terms to represent the unobserved factors that affect the utility gained by an individual $i$ if they choose alternative $j$. It may be quite reasonable to expect the unobserved factors that contribute to the utility of alternative $j$ (say the Train alternative) to be correlated with the unobserved factors that contribute to the utility of alternative $k$ (say the Bus alternative). For instance, we do not observe factors such as the access and egress time to the terminals for the train and bus modes. Given that these are ground transportation modes that require smaller terminals than airplanes, it is likely that the train and bus terminals are close to the center of downtown Sydney and downtown Melbourne, and thus likely to be closer to one's destination as opposed to the outskirts of the cities. Since these unobserved factors are likely to be correlated, the utilities of the two modes are likely to be correlated.\n",
    "\n",

    "As before, we will need to implement this specification through a random-coefficients perspective, so we will add a dummy variable to the model that is $1$ if the alternative is train or bus, and $0$ otherwise. Then, when treating the coefficient on this dummy variable as a random coefficient, we will constrain the mean to be zero, and estimate the standard deviation. This is analagous to the way that we estimated the standard deviation for the car alternative, even though the \"ASC Car\" coefficient was constrained to be zero."

    "As the estimation results show, $\\sigma_{\\textrm{Nesting Parameter}}$ is not significantly different from zero at any common alpha-level. This indicates that the utilities of the train and bus coefficients may not actually be correlated, as we might have guessed a priori. This result could have been anticipated by considering the fact that this model is a restricted version of the \"Heteroskedastic Model 1\" that was estimated earlier. Here we are restricting $\\sigma_{\\textrm{train}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\textrm{bus}}$ terms to be the same value, and we are calling this value $\\sigma_{\\textrm{Nesting Parameter}}$. Given that neither parameter in the unrestricted model had a statistically significant difference from zero, we could anticipate that the restricted model would also not result in a parameter estimate that had a statistically significant difference from zero."
