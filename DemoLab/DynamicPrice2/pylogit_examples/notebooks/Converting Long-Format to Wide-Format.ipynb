    "# Converting long-format dataframes to wide-format\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the conversion of long-format data into wide-format. Long-format data contains one row per available alternative per choice situation. In contrast, wide-format data contains one row per choice situation. PyLogit and other software packages (e.g. mlogit in R) use data that is in long-format. However, other software packages, such as Statsmodels in Python or Python BIOGEME, use data that is in wide-format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different software packages have different data format requirements, it is useful to be able to convert one's data from one format to another. Other PyLogit example notebooks (such as the \"Main PyLogit Example\") demonstrate how to take data from wide-format and convert it into long-format. This notebook will demonstrate the reverse process: taking data from long-format and converting it into wide-format.\n",

    "The dataset being used in this example is the \"Travel Mode Choice\" dataset from Greene and Hensher. It is described on the statsmodels <a href=\"http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/0.6.0/datasets/generated/modechoice.html\">website</a>, and their description is reproduced below in full.\n",

    "As we can see above, PyLogit does a few things automatically. First, using the names provided in alt_name_dict, it will add suffixes to the alternative specific variables and the subset specific variables. These suffixes record what alternative, the given column of data is referring to. Secondly, when dealing with subset specific variables, PyLogit will only create columns of data for alternatives over which the variable actually varies. Lastly, PyLogit automatically creates columns that denote the availability of each alternative for each choice situation. These columns are suffixed to denote the alternatives that they correspond to, and they are inferred automatically from the rows present in the long-format data.\n",

    "Also, there is a \"null_value\" keyword that one can use in the conversion function. This is useful when one has alternative specific variables, and not all alternatives are available in all choice situations. In this setting, one may want to specify a value for the missing data, such as null, -999, etc. The \"null_value\" keyword argument allows one to do this."
