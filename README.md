Try to build my own recommendation system environment for further study.
Maybe I will try combine ensemble methods and recommendation algorithms later.

I changed my mind.
It's waste of time to build my own environment for study.
More attention should be token in how to improve algorithms.
So, I decide to use `Surprise` instead, which I have read the codes before.

And the framework is so awesome.
You can try to use it and develop your onw recommendation algorithm on it.
just use

```
surprise
```

I try to implement glmnet, and something wrong with it.
Thinking y, and reading some papers about coordinate optimization.

BTW, I'm learning how to write Cython.

It's time to read paper carefully.
