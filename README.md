Bpr in spark, copy from  Rodrigo and Oliveira.
Try to write pyspark.

BPR+MF with surprise.
The surprise is terrific for implement new algorithms.

Still working on slim.
And the problem is still there.
Sad.

I've work out the problem about slim with sklearn.
But the result of top-N recommendation is bad.
I'm going on to work on it.

Update SLIM for tiny matrix.

ElasticNet in sklearn doesn't support sparse matrix.
So, I will work on this problem and make it possible sooner.

I fix slim with sgd, and it works.

And I find another way to train slim with sklearn or GlmNet.

I will update slim in surprise soon.

Download dataset for ctr.

Update slim.

Try again. Failed again.
It's time to read paper carefully.

I try to implement glmnet, and something wrong with it.
Thinking y, and reading some papers about coordinate optimization.

BTW, I'm learning how to write Cython.

I try to overwrite ElasticNet which is in sklearn, and try complie the cython of cd_fast,
which can be applied in slim.

Failed...
I will try again tonight.

I changed my mind.
It's waste of time to build my own environment for study.
More attention should be token in how to improve algorithms.
So, I decide to use `Surprise` instead, which I have read the codes before.

And the framework is so awesome.
You can try to use it and develop your onw recommendation algorithm on it.
just use

```
surprise
```

Try to build my own recommendation system environment for further study.
Maybe I will try combine ensemble methods and recommendation algorithms later.
